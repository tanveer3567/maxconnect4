The evaluation function calucaltes
	1. No. of 4 continues spots of same player in a row horizaontally, vertically and both diagonals as well.
	2. No. of 3 continues spots of same player in a row horizaontally, vertically and both diagonals as well.
	3. No. of 2 continues spots of same player in a row horizaontally, vertically and both diagonals as well.
	4. No. of 1 continues spots of same player in a row horizaontally, vertically and both diagonals as well.

4's has a weight of 1000.
3's has a weight of 100
2's has a weight of 10
1's has a weight of 1

Note:
   1. Proof alpha beta pruning - for depth limit 8 , total no of leafs possible are 7^8 = 5,764,801‬. But the no of time evaluation functions is 
      called is 103,404. This means it pruned the branched in such a way that 5,661,397‬ leaves got eliminated.(you can verify this by uncommenting the line 
      number 15 in evaluation.py file).
   2. Program may be little slow with increasing depths but it tends to gets fast as the no of spots get filled, 
      the subroutine of the evaluation function i.e get counts has breaks and continue statements to eleminate rows and
      coloumns that no longer can contribute to increasing players score.
   3. The program always wins againts a random opponent and sub-optimal opponent, makes a draw against a optimal opponent.
